# React.forwardRef

https://reactjs.org/docs/react-api.html#reactforwardref

> suitable for if u want to pass down the ref to functional component which is in child

> difference between above code in createRef in which we are also accessing the whole child component through Ref (so therefore all the DOM node in child) in Forward Ref we can directly access the DOM node through Ref and u don,t need to create another Ref in child like previous approach
