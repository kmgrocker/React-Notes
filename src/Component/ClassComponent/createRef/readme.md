# React.createRef() 

1. as we know we can directly access any DOM node by using ref attribute and capturing its reference through createRef and its current property 

2. through Ref we can directly reference a whole Component 

see `focusInput and Input` component for that  

3. there is also forward Ref technique which is to access direct native DOM inside child component By using ForwardRef Higher Order Component
