# Refs in class component

as you can see the refs is already available on class by ref attribute and this.refs see MyVComponent

# React.createRef()

1. as we know we can directly access any DOM node by using ref attribute and capturing its reference through createRef and its current property

2. through Ref we can directly reference a whole Component

see `focusInput and Input` component for that

3. there is also forward Ref technique which is to access direct native DOM inside child component By using ForwardRef Higher Order Component
